My Version of 'Project Grow'

What should it do
- A tree that goes through 4 phases (actually 5 I know, but Phase 0 doesn't count)
- Add trees to the counter after each cycle
- Random leaf generating
- Begin a new cycle after the last phase
- Show apples in the fourth phase


Additional Things I have done

- Upgrade System
  - Upgrade Button
  - Upgrade with the 'U' Key
  - Automatic Upgrades

- Clicking
  - Alternative to Klicking (Pressing a Key) for all the lazy people
  - Even another alternative to clicking, just scroll
  - Click Counter

- Miscellaneous things
  - Animated icon in the browser tab (favicon)
  - Save and Load your data (only temporary, until you close your browser)
  - Colorful buttons
  - Apples now have different colors (more than 50 shades of apples)
  - Amount of apple per cycle (up till 100) will be displayed on the tree
  - Cheat your way through by using the 'C' key on your keyboard to instantly add apples
