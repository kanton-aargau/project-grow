My Version of 'Project Grow'

What should it do
- A tree that goes through 4 phases (actually 5 I know, but Phase 0 doesn't count)
- Add trees to the counter after each cycle
- Random leaf generating
- Begin a new cycle after the last phase


Additional Things I have done

- Upgrade System
- Upgrade Button
- Upgrade with the 'U' Key
- Alternative to Klicking (Pressing a Key) for all the lazy people
- Click Counter
- Automatic Upgrading
- Footer with the link to the old version
- Animated icon in the browser tab (favicon)
- Save and Load button (temporary stored with sessionStorage)
- Colorful buttons
