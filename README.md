# project-grow
My Version of 'Project Grow'

What should it do
- A tree that goes through 4 phases (actually 5 I know, but Phase 0 doesn't count)
- Add trees to the counter after each cycle
- Random leaf generating
- Begin a new cycle after the last phase


Additional Things I have done to the Project

- Upgrade System
- Upgrade Button
- Upgrade with the 'U' Key
- Alternative to Klicking (Pressing a Key) for all the lazy people
- Click Counter
- Automatic Upgrading
- Bad footer, will fix it sometime later
